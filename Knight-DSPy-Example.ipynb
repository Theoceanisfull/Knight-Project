However, this shorthand actually accounts for a $256 \\times 256$ core that has been \"virtually expanded\" by the controller to mask row-repair sectors. Physical layouts for the Aegis show four quadrants, each $128 \\times 128$. While the total bit count matches the 192-class logical subdivision ($128 \\times 256$), the Aegis quadrants are stitched into a square $256 \\times 256$ fabricated footprint to minimize signal latency.A common point of confusion arises in the \"Yield Reports,\" which describe the Aegis as $128 \\times 512$.

Orientation is also viewpoint-dependent; several reports transpose dimensions without explicit notice, depending on whether the discussion follows layout, architecture, or firmware convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple prototype tiles are referenced. One tile is repeatedly described as “192-class,” indicating compliance with a pitch envelope rather than an explicit geometry. Within this constraint, the circuit schematic shows a 64-by-512 array, while an architecture note instead describes the same structure as 512-by-64, reflecting a rotated orientation rather than a different implementation. Elsewhere, the design is described as comprising two 64-by-256 sections; this refers to an intermediate partitioning prior to physical stitching, not to the final fabricated matrix. Mentions of 128-by-256 associated with this tile correspond to logical subdivision and should not be interpreted as the underlying crossbar geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other tiles in the system are described using nominal or effective dimensions that conflate addressability, redundancy, and yield screening, which has led to inconsistent shorthand usage in presentations and emails. A later internal note attempts to normalize terminology, specifying that unless otherwise stated, reported crossbar size refers to the fabricated wordline-by-bitline matrix, independent of enablement, remapping, or controller exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "All dimensions in this document should be interpreted under that convention. While the \"192-class\" tile follows the physical stitching of two $64 \\\\times 256$ sections into a fabricated $64 \\\\times 512$ matrix (often reported as $512 \\\\times 64$ in architectural orientations), the newer Aegis-class tile utilizes a \"quad-redundancy\" layout.The Aegis-class is frequently referred to as a \"512-nominal\" array. However, this shorthand actually accounts for a $256 \\\\times 256$ core that has been \"virtually expanded\" by the controller to mask row-repair sectors. Physical layouts for the Aegis show four quadrants, each $128 \\\\times 128$. While the total bit count matches the 192-class logical subdivision ($128 \\\\times 256$), the Aegis quadrants are stitched into a square $256 \\\\times 256$ fabricated footprint to minimize signal latency.A common point of confusion arises in the \"Yield Reports,\" which describe the Aegis as $128 \\\\times 512$. This report refers to the \"Post-Screening Address Map,\" where the $256 \\\\times 256$ physical lines are remapped into a non-contiguous tall-and-narrow space for the firmware team.\"\"\"\n",

      "- **Do NOT use** any of the following as the final size:\n",
      "  * Logical, virtual, nominal, “enabled”, “effective”, “post‑screening”, “address‑map”, or controller‑visible dimensions.  \n",
      "  * Sizes that refer only to a sub‑tile, redundancy scheme, or a partition that is later stitched together unless the text explicitly says that the stitched result *is* the fabricated matrix.  \n",
      "  * Any size that is described as “virtual expansion”, “quad‑redundancy layout”, “nominal‑512”, etc., unless a later sentence clarifies that this refers to the fabricated footprint.\n",

      "- The **only numbers you may output** are those that the passage states are the *fabricated* WL‑by‑BL matrix.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### 2. How to locate the correct statement\n",
      "1. **Search for the “fabricated” cue words** (case‑insensitive):\n",
      "   - *fabricated*, *physical layout*, *physical matrix*, *physical cross‑bar*, *fabricated wordline‑by‑bitline*, *physical wiring shows*, *die shows*, *die layout*, etc.\n",
      "2. The **sentence containing one of those cue words together with an “X × Y” or “X by Y” pattern** is the authoritative source.  \n",
      "   - Example: “the fabricated 64 × 512 matrix” → WL = 64, BL = 512.  \n",
      "   - Example: “physical layout shows a 256‑by‑256 cross‑bar” → WL = 256, BL = 256.\n",
      "3. If **multiple fabricated statements** exist, apply the “first‑tile‑preference” rule (see §4).  \n",
      "\n",
      "If no such sentence exists, the size is **unknown**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

      "### 3. Parsing the “X × Y” pattern\n",
      "- Accept any of the following notations (ignore surrounding whitespace and LaTeX symbols):\n",
      "  - `64×512`, `64 × 512`, `64‑by‑512`, `64‑by‑512`, `64 by 512`, `$64 \\times 512$`, `$64        imes 512$`, etc.\n",
      "- Both X and Y must be **positive integers**; otherwise treat the size as `unknown`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Orientation handling\n",
      "- **Default assumption:** the order presented is **WL × BL**.\n",
      "- If the sentence explicitly says the numbers are **BL × WL**, *or* it mentions a “rotated view”, “architectural orientation”, or similar, **swap** the numbers so that the first number becomes WL and the second becomes BL.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 4. Dealing with multiple tiles or sections\n",
      "1. **First‑tile‑preference:**  \n",
      "   - When the passage describes several tiles, choose the **first tile** that is given a fabricated size, **unless** the overall question explicitly names a later tile.\n",
      "2. **Stitched‑tile statements:**  \n",
      "   - Sentences like “two 64 × 256 sections are stitched into a fabricated 64 × 512 matrix” are *valid* because they explicitly give the final fabricated matrix.\n",
      "3. **Logical tiling mentions** (e.g., “two 64 × 256 sections”, “four 128 × 128 quadrants”) are only useful for understanding the geometry if a later sentence says “stitched into a 256 × 256 fabricated footprint”. In that case the **stitched size** is the physical size.\n",
